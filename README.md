# TaskMate

TaskMate is a simple, classroom-friendly task management app designed for **primary education teachers and students**. Teachers can create classes, post assignments, and update them as needed. Students can log in to see the tasks for their class, read the instructions, track due dates, and mark assignments as complete. The goal is to create an easy, kid-friendly way to keep everyone on the same page.

## Purpose

TaskMate helps classrooms stay organized by giving teachers a straightforward space to manage assignments and giving students a single, easy-to-understand dashboard for their work. It reduces confusion, supports student responsibility, and keeps task information clear and accessible. The focus is on simplicity, clarity, and ease of use for young learners who may be using a task app for the first time.
